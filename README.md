# nyx

IRC Bouncer written in Lisp, based on a special architecture.

## Description

The point is to have a core package connecting to IRC, and several
kind of clients can be spawned. As of right now, there is only an REPL
client, and an IRC client (basically, an IRC bouncer) is being
written. A web client is in the roadmap.
